# TODO List for Adding CAT Title and Image to Webpage

- [x] Edit templates/index.html to add a new title section at the top of the container with "CAT" text and a cat image (using https://placekitten.com/100/100 as placeholder).
- [x] Style the new title section to make it prominent and centered.
- [x] Test the webpage by running the Flask app and verifying the title and image appear correctly.
